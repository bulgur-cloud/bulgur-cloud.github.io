## Documentation

The Bulgur Cloud documentation (the website you are on right now!) is a
collaborative document. If you see something missing, or something that could be
improved, you can edit the page by clicking the "Edit this page" button at the
bottom of the page.

If you are a bit more technically inclined, you can clone the [docs repository](https://github.com/bulgur-cloud/bulgur-cloud.github.io)
and edit it with your preferred editor or IDE. This is the better choice if you want
to make a lot of changes or add new pages, as you'll be able to see a full preview.

## Code

Bulgur Cloud is an open source project, and contributions are welcome. The
project repository has a [list of issues](https://github.com/bulgur-cloud/bulgur-cloud/issues),
feel free to pick up any that look interesting! You can leave a comment to
ask for clarification or help if you need it.

If you have any new features you'd like to implement, you can do that as well.
You should first open a new issue and describe the feature to get feedback on
it, especially if it's a big feature that will take a lot of effort.
